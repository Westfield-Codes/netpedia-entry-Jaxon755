  <h2>Definition / Description</h2>
  <p> These are some web browsers that can access your data when ever you use them. Browsers or Websites may track your online activity by using a cookie or pixel to identify you even after you leave the site. Or they may use device fingerprinting â€” a technique that uses your browser's unique configurations and settings to track your activity.</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><strong>First-party cookies</strong> are directly created by the website you are using. These are generally safer, as long as you are browsing reputable websites or ones that have not been compromised by a recent data breach or cyberattack.</p>
  <p><strong>Third-party cookies</strong> are generated by websites that are different from the pages that the users are currently surfing, usually because they're linked to ads on that page. Third-party cookies let advertisers or analytics companies track an individual's browsing history across the web on any sites that contain their ads.</p>
